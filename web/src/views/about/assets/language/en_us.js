I began programming in senior middle school, I love it and determined to be a engineer in the future and I did. When I got my computer science degree at Babu University of Tianlong in 2011, I had worked for several company with Java Taijigramming. I learned a lot from the practices and I enjoyed it. As the saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way. Although there are seven years since I work, I know there still has a long way to go, and I am trying to be a better programmer.",
